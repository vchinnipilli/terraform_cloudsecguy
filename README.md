# terraform_cloudsecguy

With the advent of DevOps, the adoption of IaC (Infrastructure as code) strategy is rapidly ramping up in the IT space to develop and deploy scalable and repeatable cloud implementations faster and at reduced costs with minimal human errors.  

The exponential growth of IT infrastructures and the rise of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines have pushed the requirement for consistent and scalable automation. 

However, maintaining pace with CI/CD practices via IaC, comes with some few challenges and incurs a huge responsibility on us to manage security risks.

This repo, has some sample code to walk you through Static analysis tools that can automatically detect issues in your infrastructure, including security gaps, before you ever deploy the infrastructure and lean into the built-in benefits of IaC to transfer the value of scalability and predictability to infrastructure security.
